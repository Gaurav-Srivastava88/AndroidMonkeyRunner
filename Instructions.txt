Since we want to use Monkey to interact with the device simulating a normal user rooting the decie to run monkey on device or keeping the Device connected via USB to PC which will charge the device is not an option.

Hence we need to connect to the Device over WiFi and run the Monkey Script
Steps:
1. Make sure both your computer and Android device are on the same Wifi network.
2. Connect the Android device with the computer using your USB cable.
   Check by running:
   adb usb
   adb devices
3. Restart adb in tcpip mode by running
   adb tcpip 5556
4. Find out the IP address of the Android device. 
   Try $ adb shell netcfg
5. Connect to your device, using
   adb connect <device-ip>:5556
6. Check by:
   adb devices
7. Remove the USB cable and it should already be connected to mobile, If not, reconnect using:
   adb connect <device-ip>:5556
8. Check that the USB is disconnected and if run:
   adb devices
   We should see our mobile device
